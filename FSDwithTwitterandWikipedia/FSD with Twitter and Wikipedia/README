*******Event Detection 'Twitter and Wikipedia articles' by Estifanos Simegnew Getiye, and Offorji Godson EKezie. MMnet 2014-2015.*********

Thanks to Daniele Miorandi, Nicola Conci & Emanuele Sansone our tutors, We got to this point of achieving the project as fruit of your guide over our case study 'FSD from Twitter text stream and Wikipedia articles' during this course(MMnet) of our master studies in TLC at the University of Trento. We acknowledge your great effort and help rendered for the success of this project.

General Usage Description
	1.	Download the project from the git repository and Import it on Eclipse
	2.	Make sure that the Eclipse you are using has WindowBuilder plugin, otherwise you will not be able to run the application
	3.	Under src, open TwitterWikiPackage and Run the class named GraphicalUserInterface.java as a java application
	4.	A graphical user interface (gui) will be displayed 
	5.	Interact with the application with the gui to proceed with functionality you want

Graphical User Interface Interaction Brief Description 
	Detect events: this button is used to detect events.
	Change Parameters: is used to change parameters both for twitter and Wikipedia event detections.
	Generate Keywords: is used to create nwt and nts files (inputs to the EDCoW algorithm) 
	Fetch Tweets: is used to stream twitter data from twitter API. 
Brief Description of Parameters
	Tweet Sample Interval(Sec): this is the interval in a time unit of seconds, in which we want to sample the tweets that are being fetched.
	Tweet Fetch Total Time(min): this is the total amount of time in minutes that tweets are going to be fetched/streamed. 
	Tweet Date(YYYYMMDD): this is a folder name where the streamed tweets are going to be stored in. For convenience, it is naming is: if are fetching on May 21, 2015, then we name it 20150521. 
	EDCoW Debug Mode: is a boolean value that tells EDCoW to store some output files or not. 
	EDCoW Size Window: is the length of the window used by EDCoW to treat the whole signals (nt, nwt).
	EDCoW Delta: is the sliding window size for the second signal construction stage of EDCow implementation.
	EDCoW gamma 1:  is used to calculate theta1 (the first threshold value to remove trivial words)
	EDCoW gamma2: is used to calculate theta2 (the second threshold value to select the words that should remain for modularity check)
	EDCoW Threshold: is the final threshold value (epsilon threshold) that determines if a cluster from the modularity check step is to be considered an event or not.
	Wikipedia Sample Interval(hr): is Wikipedia’s sliding window size value. 
	Wikipedia Page Count: is page view threshold to check for z-score value of a Wikipedia page or not.
	Wikipedia Z-Score:  is the z-score threshold to consider a given Wikipedia page title as an event or not.
External Libraries Used
	Commons-lang-2.0.jar :  is included to use it during the tokenization of tweets to unescape HTML-escaped twitter texts. 
	Jmod-1.2b.jar, Jtransforms-2.4.jar, jWave_java_groovy.jar: these three libraries are included within the EDCoW itself to implement modularity check and wavelet analysis of words respectively.
	twitter4j-core-4.0.3.jar and twitter4j-stream-4.0.3.jar : are included to be able to connect to Twitter Api and stream tweets.
